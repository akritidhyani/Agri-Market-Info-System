# Agricultural Market Information System

## Overview
Our project aims to increase transparency in agricultural markets by providing real-time information on prices, demand, and supply for various crops and commodities. By reducing information asymmetry, we aim to contribute to price stability, enabling stakeholders to make well-informed decisions in response to market dynamics. Additionally, our system helps farmers and traders mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations, empowering them to plan and manage their resources effectively. Furthermore, by providing historical and current market data, we aim to empower farmers in negotiations, giving them leverage in price discussions.

## Functionalities
### Real-time Market Information
- Provide users with up-to-date information on market prices, demand and supply dynamics, and relevant trends for selected agricultural commodities.

### Historical Data Analysis
- Allow users to analyze historical market data to identify patterns, make informed decisions, and strategize for the future.

## Out of Scope Functionalities
### Market Predictions
- Predicting future market conditions or prices beyond historical trends is out of scope. The system provides historical data for users to make their own assessments.
